This is the code for BMC Bioinformatics paper A CNN-LSTM-based deep learning method for identifying Autism spectrum disorders risk RNA.

The dataset is in the feature extraction dictionary, there are gene instances for ASD and no-ASD. Then, the gene expression values and RNA transcript sequences can be found form BrainSpan and GENCODE.
